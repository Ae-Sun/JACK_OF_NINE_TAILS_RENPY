- clothes delivery. Why not again (cost extra 2 sparks per item, can be accesible on slave equipment screen ) - WIP
- the game doesn't difference between doble handed weapon and single handed ( Code problem, the equipment code it's already very complex, I dont want to make it even more complex. I will take other approch(If left or rigth hand has a doble handed weapon and left or rigth hand have a weapon will recieve a penalty in combat ))
