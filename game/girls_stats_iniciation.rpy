Your slave's rank will never rise higher than her beauty or fame (whichever is higher). At auctions, beautiful slaves are sold for higher prices.","   ll your efforts to improve the appearance of the slave will influence style, not beauty. Stylishness is important too, but the value of natural beauty is huge. You can increase beauty only by neoplasty surgery in the Technosphere medical center and only once for each slave. Try to buy beautiful slaves if you intend to train them to high ranks. Beauty is decreased while a slave has scars or bruises until they are removed or healed."],

Critical decrease of endurance can kill your slave.","   If your slave is weak, feed her well; it's desirable to prescribe supplements and not let her become exhausted (receive red energy stars), nor over-exercise (when she has purple energy stars, intensive exercise is harmful), nor gain weight if she is overweight, nor end the day with negative calories. Build endurance with gymnastics, athletics, dance, racing, martial arts, pet play or vigorous sex. Heal injuries (a nurse assistant and your own skill helps) and sicknesses, and use drugs sparingly."],

On the other hand she is turned on much faster and is more lively, which makes her attractive for customers.","   Callousness develops quickly with mistreatment. Severe punishments are especially harmful. While a less sensitive slave is hardened against depression and endures suffering, she is also less valuable. There are no reliable ways to increase a slave's empathy, but refined petting and pleasures may help."],

Calm ones are easier to control.","   Temperament is an ambiguous feature. More emotional slaves are harder to control, but cold ones are less valuable. By suppressing initiative, driving her into depression and silencing her you will eventually lower her temperament. Getting her to express herself or interact openly with the slaver will often increase temperament."],

But it is easier to dominate and manipulate stupid ones.","   Smarts are not always useful, as more intellectual slaves are harder to control and manipulate. On the other hand, rational factors of submission and explanatory conversations will be more effective. Allowing a slave to express herself, training secretarial skills and doing household accounting can contribute to intellectual development."],
    "nature":        ["Spineless"       ,"Coward"         ,"Uncertain"     ,"Independent"  ,"Determined"   ,"Willful"        ,"Willful+"    ,"{b}NATURE:{/b}\n  Strong character makes a slave more interesting and independent but lowers her obedience. It is easier to control weak-willed slaves but their value will be lower too.","   Nature is an ambiguous feature. It is very hard to train a willful slave, but a weak will lowers a slave's value. The more you make a slave do what she does not want to do, the more her nature will break. It is difficult to restore nature, so do not overdo it. Victory in duels, martial arts, sleeping in her own room, assisting in training other slaves, and being given a measure of independence or opportunities to socialize can help in the formation of a solid nature."],

It also causes her to resist your will, and refuse humiliating orders.","   Pride is harmful both in training and in the sale, so you should work on her openness. Force her to do dirty, perverted and degrading things, and assign strict rules. Eventually pride will be broken and the slave will become more open. But do not overdo it, as with pride, you can break the very slave."],

You can increase exoticism with tattoos, piercings, body modifications, as well as flamboyant clothes and wigs."],
    "physical":      ["Corpulent"       ,"Chubby"         ,"Voluptuous"    ,"Slender"      ,"Model"        ,"Bony"           ,"Model+"      ,"{b}PHYSICAL:{/b}\n  You can get more mince from fat slaves but they are not attractive. Weedy starvelings aren't attractive as well, but you can't get a lot of meat from them either. It's better to keep your slave slim, but not skinny.","   Extra weight is generally harmful, as well as a lack of it. To keep your slave slim you need to balance her nutrition in a way that is sufficient, but not excessive. The more a slave works and the more endurance she has, the more food she needs. Physical exercises don't decrease weight directly but are a good way to burn extra calories. If a slave is underweight, feed her well and minimize athletics."],
    "style":         ["Unfashionable"   ,"Unremarkable"   ,"Common"        ,"Stylish"      ,"Refined"      ,"Elegant"        ,"Elegant+"    ,"{b}STYLE:{/b}\n  A slave's appearance is extremely important during the sale. Customers will like well-groomed and well-dressed slaves, and an unappealing slave can be turned down even if she fits the requirements.","   Style depends little on natural abilities and skills, though it is influenced by the ability to communicate (elocution) and presence (dancing). Style suffers from dirt and sloppiness. Hairstyle, make-up, perfume, beautiful clothes and jewelry - all of these improve style and make the slave more attractive to customers. It is not necessary to constantly maintain style - it plays a role only when it is time to show the girl to the customer."],

Your slave's rank can reach the level of her fame, even if she lacks other attributes, beauty included.","   Fame is not the most important parameter for a slave. You can train wonderful product unconcerned about this. Fame will grow with victories in the arena and colosseum.","   Fame is not the most important parameter for a slave.

    "writer": "Writing was my gift. Poems, stories, and praise followed. I even got published. But the masterpiece I started — I never got to finish it.",
    "major": "Teen drama gave way to wild nights and street races. I was a party queen, wrecking luxury cars for thrills. It was a hell of a ride.",
